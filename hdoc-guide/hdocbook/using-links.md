# Using Links In Documentation

This article covers the various ways in which you can use links within the Hornbill Docs documentation system. Markdown provides
a very simple syntax for adding links, and links can refer to other parts of the same article, another article in the current book, an article in another book, or various forms of links to documents and resources outside of the Hornbill Docs system.

When creating links, the text of the link should be readable, meaningful, and describe the thing being linked to. Creating a link with text that is written like [click here](#) is not recommended. Instead, something [using links](#) is better, as this not only helps with readability but also helps with search engine optimizations too.

There are two types of links you can use on the Hornbill Docs platform; external and internal. 

An external link is any valid fully-qualified URL to a site other than the Hornbill Docs system. Links to other sites will generally open the resource in a new tab or window in your browser. In today's internet it's very rare that non-https URLs are used, and it's recommended that you always only ever link to secure web sites. An example of an external link would be

```md
[Google in the UK](https://www.google.co.uk)
```

and would render as: [Google in the UK](https://www.google.co.uk)


An internal link is a link to another article or resource within the Hornbill Docs system. Links to other pages are generally opened within the same browser session, updating the navigation history etc., so the user can use the Back button to go to the previous page as they navigate around your documentation content. For example,

```md
[Using Links](/hdoc-guide/hdocbook/using-links)
```

would render as: [Using Links](/hdoc-guide/hdocbook/using-links)

It should be noted that when you specify a link to another page, that page is typically a markdown file with a .md file extension. However you should **never** include the .md part in any internal link. This is because the Hornbill Docs system generates static site content at build time and markdown is typically transformed to a .html file. Both the 'hdoc Preview Server' and Hornbill documentation server will locate the correct resource based on the URL without the extension. 

## Hornbill Docs URL Structure

It's helpful to understand the structure of the Hornbill Docs system. URLs purposefully include the file and folder names of content within each book. This is done because, at build time, static HTML content is generated and it's important there is a consistent strategy for dealing with URLs to make sure that documents are referenced correctly, and to make sure there is a consistent mapping between the published content and the article source code, which is typically in a GitHub repository. 

A Hornbill Docs URL is made up as follows: -

`https://docs.hornbill.com/[language-code]/{book-id}/path/to/article`

- **language-code** - this is an optional segment but, if provided, tells the docs server which language variation to serve (if available). Examples might be en-gb, de-de, us etc...
- **book-id** - every published book is allocated a unique identifier. The book-id is that unique identifier. 

When specifying an internal URL as a link to an Article, you should never specify the language-code; this will be taken care of automatically. All internal URLs should be referenced from the root of the Hornbill Docs system. For example, if you wanted to reference this specific article, you would specify

```md
[Using Links](/hdoc-guide/hdocbook/using-links)
```

which would render the following link: [Using Links](/hdoc-guide/hdocbook/using-links)


## Linking To Third-Party Sites

The purpose of the Hornbill Docs site is primarily to provide access to Hornbill's documentation. With that in mind, we want to ensure that links to third-party sites, while sometimes useful, are kept to a minimum. It's in the best interest of the user experience to minimize the amount of "site exit" links, so when creating these, we should **always** consider the following: -

- **Accountability**: We should always link to third-party content when it's the third-party's information to share or responsibility to support. As an example, we might want to explain to a customer in our documentation how to use another software product, but it's generally not our place to tell that story, but rather it's better to simply link to that documentation and allow that other vendor to provide that information in the way that's most appropriate for them. 
- **Implied Promotion**: The primary goal of the Hornbill Docs web site is to provide documentation about Hornbill's products and services. We may from time to time feel it's useful for our customers to reference other tools, products, or services because it relates to the job they are currently doing with Hornbill's products.  However, we are not Google selling advertising and we should generally not be promoting other products. 
- **Actual Promotion**: We will not take requests from companies, individuals, or other entities to include links on our documentation pages to their products.  Likewise, if we accept contributions to our documentation from third parties, we will not accept or allow any links that are in any way promotional. Links may be allowed if they are genuinely helpful, but not if they are both genuinely helpful **and** promotional.
- **Relevance**: Third party content can and will change without our knowledge, so it's always best to keep external referenced to a minimum. We will from time to time look for and correct dead links.
